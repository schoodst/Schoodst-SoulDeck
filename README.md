# Really stupid deck
## Deck features
- Stupid high spectral card appearances
- starts with *7* Soul cards
- almost 100 dollars off start (we love money)
- 100+ joker slots
- 100+ consumable slots
- All you get is spades. NO other suits
- Hand size to hold them ALL
## Specific Strategies
### Perkeo Duping (1)
- Use souls for all 5 legendaries (DONT USE MORE WITHOUT SHOWMAN. YOU WILL GET BASE JOKER)
- ~~Pray to Jimbo you get showman~~ **You now start with a poly showman in 1.0.1**
- Get showman, and use it to farm souls for Infinite Perkeo
- Get telescope and observatory, and find a planet card for your best played (which should be FlFive at this point)
- duplicate with 83 Perkeos for ultra scaling till naninf
### Weegee run
This one requires a lil setupping
- Get at least 5-10 Kings or Queens (has to be either 5-10 kings or 5-10 queens for FlFive)
- Discard them at the start of a round
- Use Ouija to turn all the non-King/non-Queen cards into a rank
- You now have 40+ identical cards, make them steel, gold, or whatever else
- Could also try to get them to be other face cards for joker synergy
